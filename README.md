pvaClientTestCPP
============

**WARNING**: _This module is only relevant to the EPICS V4 version 4.5.x releases.
For EPICS V4 version 4.6.x and later this code has been moved into the exampleCPP module._

pvaClientTestCPP provides examples for pvaClient and pvDatabase.
There are two reasons for a separate repository:

* The examples caused circural dependices between repositories.
* The examples required a running pvAccess server

pvaClientTestCPP provides the following:

* An EPICS IOC that has both EPICS V3 DBRecords, V4 PVRecords, and pvaSrv for accessing the DBRecords.
* examples for pvaClient
* examples for pvDatabase
* make runtests
